Welcome to the WeatherTop Version 2
==============================

This is my Weather Top Project for Web Development 2 for the SETU Higher Diploma in Computer Science 2022.

This project allows users to sign up and log on.
Users can add weather stations unique to their account
Users can add, delete and update information on weather station readings and view information on latest readings

This is an Express.js project, designed to work well with the Glitch development environment. It includes basic express setup, templating, routing, JSON based model and session support.
